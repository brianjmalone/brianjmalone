# Wetworks to Networks

I spent 20+ years recording from neurons in animal brains—neurosurgery, actual electrodes, and microdrives. Oddly enough, neurophysiology experiments feel a lot like being a radio operator on a submarine.

Now I'm building ML systems and leveraging AI tools for science. Here, I'm documenting the journey from academic papermilling to building scalable, production-grade systems, and talking about my favorite tools and tricks (I see you there uv, fd, and rg!)
