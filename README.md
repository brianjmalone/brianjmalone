# Wetwork to Networks

I spent 20+ years recording from neurons in actual brains—neurosurgery, electrodes, microdrives, the whole thing. (Neurophysiology experiments can feel like being an deep sea explorer in a bathysphere. I do miss that part!)

Now I'm interested in building ML systems and leveraging AI tools for answering broader questions in science and beyond. Here, I'm documenting the journey from academic papermilling to building scalable, production-grade systems, talking about my favorite tools (e.g., uv, fd, and rg) and tricks, and contributing to and learning from the wider computing community.
