# Wetworks to Networks

---
**Background:** Ph.D. in Neural Science (NYU), 20+ years in systems/computational neuroscience (UCLA, UCSF, UC Davis) on sensation and perception.

I spent 20+ years recording from neurons in animal brains—neurosurgery, actual electrodes, and microdrives. Oddly enough, neurophysiology experiments feel a lot like being a radio operator on a submarine. 

Now I'm building ML systems and leveraging AI tools for science. 

Here, I'm documenting the journey from academic papermilling to building scalable, production-grade systems, and talking about my favorite tools and tricks (I see you there uv, fd, and rg!)
