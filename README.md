# Neural Networking *in vivo* and *in silico*

I spent 20+ years recording from neurons in actual brains—neurosurgery, electrodes, microdrives—the whole thing. I'm interested in building ML systems and leveraging AI tools for answering questions in science and beyond. 

Here, I'm documenting what I'm learning about building scalable, production-grade systems, talking about frameworks and tooling, and archiving Lessons Learned to help people on similar paths. 

In addition to code repos, I have a [GistHub](https://gist.github.com/brianjmalone/6ac6b1cde1f44fa414aebc50b8e2ee77) to collect my thoughts.
