# Wetworks to Networks

I spent 20+ years recording from neurons in animal brains—actual electrodes, actual surgery, actual signal processing. Now I'm learning to build ML systems that don't require a craniotomy.

Computational neuroscientist transitioning to data science and AI engineering. I'm documenting the journey from academic MATLAB to production Python, from single-investigator projects to collaborative engineering, from "publish when perfect" to learning out loud.

**What I'm learning right now:**
- Software engineering practices that don't come naturally to scientists
- Python ecosystem beyond `numpy` and `matplotlib`
- How to ship code that other humans can actually use

**Background:** Ph.D. in Neural Science (NYU), 20+ years in systems/computational neuroscience (UCLA, UCSF, UC Davis) on sensation and perception.
